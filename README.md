# LetsBake
This is the repository for Baking App project for Google India Scholarship 2018.
This app fetches JSON data and displays the steps and ingredients for the recipes. It uses ExoPlayer to play the videos and also features a widget that displays the ingredients of the selected recipe.
This project uses Espresso to test some of the UI functionalities in the App.
